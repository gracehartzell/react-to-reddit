# React to Reddit

Creating a Reddit clone so that I can get out of the 'researcher' stage of learning and jump into the real *hard parts* of it! 

## Running the app 
* **Development Mode**
`npm start`: this will open the app on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). 
* **Production Mode**
`npm run build`: bundles the app and optimizes the build for best performance. This is the structure you want when deploying your app.

This project was initialized with `create-react-app`. You can find it's documentation in the `Scripted-README.md` or on the [website](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
